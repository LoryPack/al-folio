I have two preprints on arXiv exploring an alternative to adversarial training to train generative networks; the [first](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08217) applies it to probabilistic forecasting, while the [second](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15784) is concerned with Likelihood-Free Inference. I feel that is a promising overlooked approach. Happy to hear any feedback! :smile:
