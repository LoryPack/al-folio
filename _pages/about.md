I work on large language models safety with [Dr Owain Evans](https://owainevans.github.io/). I am broadly interested in technical and policy approaches to address the societal impact of AI.

I have recently defended my PhD in Statistics and Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, during which I mostly worked on inference for generative models, spanning Bayesian simulation-based inference and training methods for generative neural networks. Some of the approaches I developed build on concepts from probabilistic forecasting. My supervisors were Prof. [Ritabrata Dutta](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/dutta/) (Uni. Warwick) and Prof. [Geoff Nicholls](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/all-people/geoff-nicholls/) (Uni. Oxford). I was also interested in conformal prediction, normalizing flows, gradient-based MCMC methods and weather forecasting.

Prior to my PhD studies, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Physical Engineering from Politecnico di Torino (Italy). Afterwards, I studied towards an MSc in Physics of Complex Systems awarded by Politecnico di Torino and Universit√© Paris-Sud, France. I have carried out my MSc thesis at [LightOn](https://lighton.ai/), a machine learning startup in Paris.
