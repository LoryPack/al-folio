I am a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Oxford. I have mostly worked on Bayesian inference for likelihood-free models, exploiting deep learning tools and generalized Bayesian inference. More recently, I have become interested in probabilistic forecasting, specifically for the field of weather prediction. My supervisors are Dr. [Ritabrata Dutta](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/dutta/) (Uni. Warwick) and Prof. [Geoff Nicholls](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/all-people/geoff-nicholls/) (Uni. Oxford).

Prior to my PhD studies, I obtained a Bachelor degree in Physical Engineering from Politecnico di Torino (Italy). Afterwards, I studied towards an MSc in Physics of Complex Systems awarded by Politecnico di Torino and Universit√© Paris-Sud, France. I have carried out my MSc thesis at [LightOn](https://lighton.ai/), a machine learning startup in Paris.
