I am a finishing PhD student in Statistics at the University of Oxford. During my PhD, I mostly worked on inference for generative models, spanning Bayesian simulation-based inference and training methods for generative neural networks. Some approaches I developed are motivated by concepts in probabilistic forecasting. My supervisors are Dr. [Ritabrata Dutta](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/dutta/) (Uni. Warwick) and Prof. [Geoff Nicholls](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/all-people/geoff-nicholls/) (Uni. Oxford). I am now exploring the use of Large Language Models for quantifying the uncertainty in complex tasks and am broadly interested in novel methods to quantify uncertainty (such as conformal prediction and normalizing flows).

Prior to my PhD studies, I obtained a Bachelor degree in Physical Engineering from Politecnico di Torino (Italy). Afterwards, I studied towards an MSc in Physics of Complex Systems awarded by Politecnico di Torino and Universit√© Paris-Sud, France. I have carried out my MSc thesis at [LightOn](https://lighton.ai/), a machine learning startup in Paris.
