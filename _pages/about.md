I am a Research Associate at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge to develop a robust [framework](http://lcfi.ac.uk/projects/kinds-of-intelligence/recog-ai/) for evaluating the capabilities of AI systems, together with [Prof José Hernández-Orallo](http://josephorallo.webs.upv.es/) and [Dr Lucy Cheke](http://lcfi.ac.uk/people/lucy-cheke/).  

I previously worked on evaluating large language models with [Dr Owain Evans](https://owainevans.github.io/) and on technical standards for AI for the [European AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) at the [Future of Life Institute](https://futureoflife.org/). I am deeply interested in AI policy (particularly at the EU level).

I obtained a PhD in Statistics and Machine Learning at Oxford, during which I worked on Bayesian simulation-based inference and generative neural networks, building on concepts from meteorology and probabilistic forecasting. My supervisors were Prof. [Ritabrata Dutta](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/dutta/) (Uni. Warwick) and Prof. [Geoff Nicholls](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/geoff-nicholls) (Uni. Oxford). 

Prior to my PhD studies, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Physical Engineering from Politecnico di Torino (Italy) and an MSc in Physics of Complex Systems from Politecnico di Torino and Université Paris-Sud, France. I have carried out my MSc thesis at [LightOn](https://lighton.ai/), a machine learning startup in Paris.
