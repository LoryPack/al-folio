I am a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Oxford, working on Bayesian inference for likelihood-free models with the use of machine learning and deep learning tools. I am interested in applying likelihood-free inference methods to the setting of Numerical Weather Prediction. My supervisors are prof. [Ritabrata Dutta](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/dutta/) (Uni. Warwick) and prof [Geoff Nicholls](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/all-people/geoff-nicholls/) (Uni. Oxford).

Prior to my PhD studies, I obtained a Bachelor degree in Physical Engineering from Politecnico di Torino (Italy). Afterwards, I studied towards an MSc in Physics of Complex Systems awarded by Politecnico di Torino and Universit√© Paris-Sud, France. I have carried out my MSc thesis at [LightOn](https://lighton.ai/), a machine learning startup in Paris.
